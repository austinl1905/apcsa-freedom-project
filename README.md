# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Austin Liu**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Fortran** in order to help me make **a Molecular Dynamics simulation**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Good for understanding the physics behind the movement of molecules
* Good for modelling the behavior of inert gases.
##### CONS
* Not everyone likes chemistry :( (or science for that matter)
* A bit tricky to use with the CLI
