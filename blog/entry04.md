The project has been stagnant for pretty much the last 3 months, but I'm actually starting to make some good progress now. I've moved on to coding the MD from scratch, and I found actually a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQbBqndwIA) on how to do it. It's in Python, but I only need it to understand the concepts of MD so I can code it in Fortran instead.
