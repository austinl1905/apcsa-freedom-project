# Entry 6
##### 6/1/25

Getting my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yAqL1DAO_nLADlz_8idPnbmw0BmoUqkjApD7C6ccSAA/edit?usp=sharing) to even be somewhat comprehensible to the average APCSA student was a struggle, let alone a high school sophomore. Like how am I supposed to explain a vector or derivative??? Arghhh

Anyways, I tried my best. As for the code, I'm very lucky that Fortran syntax is very simple and easy to understand for someone with or without coding knowledge. Which makes sense considering it was invented for scientists to use. But even if I could do a really good job of explaining the code, the problem is that nearly every implementation is based on an equation or molecular dynamics concept that I use. So I have to explain that first. And it's really hard to do that without at least a basic knowledge of physics, calculus, chemistry, and statistics. See what I'm getting at here?

I figured what I could do is provide as many GIFs, images, and diagrams as possible to offset all of these equations in my slides. For example, the image I used on slide 12 for periodic boundary conditions was really helpful.

If I'm being completely honest, I totally forgot about making an elevator pitch and just winged it the day of the expo. But it seemed to work in my favor ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
