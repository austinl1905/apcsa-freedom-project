# Entry 6
##### 6/1/25

Getting my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yAqL1DAO_nLADlz_8idPnbmw0BmoUqkjApD7C6ccSAA/edit?usp=sharing) to even be somewhat comprehensible to the average APCSA student was a struggle, let alone a high school sophomore. Like how am I supposed to explain a vector or derivative??? Arghhh

Obviously, it was much harder compared to my project from last year. The most mathy thing I ever had to do in my code was use polar coordinates to position my meshes. No complex acceleration updates because the physics engine handled it for me. But this time I'm literally writing the physics from scratch, so it's a lot more work to explain. On top of that, there's nothing about the 3D modelling that I can really explain because that's handled by a software I just stitch to my code with a bash script.

Anyways, I tried my best. As for the code, I'm very lucky that Fortran syntax is very simple and easy to understand for someone with or without coding knowledge. Which makes sense considering it was invented for scientists to use. But even if I could do a really good job of explaining the code, the problem is that nearly every implementation is based on an equation or molecular dynamics concept that I use. So I have to explain that first. And it's really hard to do that without at least a basic knowledge of physics, calculus, chemistry, and statistics. See what I'm getting at here?

I figured what I could do is provide as many GIFs, images, and diagrams as possible to offset all of these equations in my slides. For example, the image I used on slide 12 for periodic boundary conditions was really helpful. As well as the image representing a heat bath for my thermostat algorithm. But for the most part, I had to rely on my own explanations. Because if you somehow still couldn't understand the relationship between temperature and energy, then tough luck I guess.

If I'm being completely honest, I totally forgot about making an [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92OO6TD_MQ&t=3s) and just winged it the day of the expo. But it seemed to work in my favor ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. I decided that what was most important was explaining what my project was about, the primary components, and the demo. It's also pretty different from last year, because my simulation already looked impressive on its own, so I didn't really go too in depth about how I made it. This year, it felt more necessary since I seriously doubt anyone would know what MD even is. Also, when booting up my project there's a good 20 seconds that would feel really awkward without explaining why my simulation takes so damn long to set up.

I'm currently at step 8 of the Engineering Design Process. I've "finished" my project (saying that because there are definitely things I want to add even after I present at the showcase) and now I'm just trying to figure out how to explain the entire process behind it in a way that the average high schooler can understand.

I'm working on the skills communication and consideration. The former is pretty obvious, and for consideration, I want to make this project at least somewhat interesting and display its usefulness. I guess it would be pretty boring if my entire presentation was me rambling about Lennard-Jones potentials or whatever.
